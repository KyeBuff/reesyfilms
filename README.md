This is my first client site that I'd built at the end of 2016. I took this work on for free, knowing that I didn't have the portfolio to obtain real work at the time. I worked on this during evenings and weekends and I enjoyed working on this project so much that it led to my career change in becoming a developer.

I felt that after learning some basic HTML and CSS I'd learn a lot more from building a website that would be used by real users and with the development driven by the needs of a real client.

## Interesting things that I'd learned from this project

* Grid layout with Bootstrap
* Instagram API integration using AJAX 
* Smooth scrolling with jQuery
* Image optimisation 
* HTML5 video
